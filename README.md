# -Java-PigLatin

A language game where words beginning with a vowel is appended with a "yay" while all the letters before a vowel in a consonant are swapped to the back and appended with an "ay".

Reflection : 
Code is much easier to read when tasks are broken down into functions. 
It's easy to get an overflow error when playing with length of Strings.
